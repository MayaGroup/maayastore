    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>Originally created by a designer and a developer at maayagroup, MaayaShop has become one of the most popular digital market and open branch in the world.</p>
    <p>MaayaShop was created at maayagroup in mid-2020 by @mdo and @fat. Prior to being an open multiple branch in the world, MaayaShop was known as <em>Market Blueprint</em>. A few months into development, Maayagroup held its first Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for fashion design at the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today.</p>

    <p>Originally released on 2020, we&rsquo;ve since had over releases, including two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With MaayaShop, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.</p>
    <p>With MaayaShop, we once again rewrote the project to account for two key architectural changes: a migration to Sass and the move to CSS&rsquo;s flexbox. Our intention is to help in a small way to move the web development community forward by pushing for newer CSS properties, fewer dependencies, and new technologies across more modern browsers.</p>
    <p>Our latest release, Bootstrap 5 (currently in development), focuses on improving v4&rsquo;s codebase with as few major breaking changes as possible. We improved existing features and components, removed support for older browsers, dropped jQuery for regular JavaScript, and embraced more future-friendly technologies like CSS custom properties as part of our tooling.</p>
